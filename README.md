WfcReplay
=========

WfcReplay is a command-line Windows utility written in C# that automatically generates an Action Replay DS code for a Nintendo DS game that will make it use HTTP instead of HTTPS for connections to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. This is done by pre-finding all URLs in the ROM and patching them in-memory. This can be used to connect to any custom Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection server.

To run this program, the .NET Framework 4.0 or higher must be installed on your computer.

The program is still in an early state, so the code is a mess and it will not work with all games.

Usage
-----
```
WfcReplay.exe rompath
```

To use WfcReplay, pass it the file path of an NDS ROM. You can also drag-and-drop the ROM file onto the WfcReplay executable. WfcReplay will then analyze the ROM and produce a text file containing the Action Replay DS code, which will be written to the current working directory.

Compatibility
-------------
WfcReplay should work with most older NDS games. It does not yet support some of the newer games, such as Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, that use particular forms of anti-piracy protection.

Notes
-----
* Action Replay DS codes generated by WfcReplay may interfere with certain Action Replay DS codes from other sources, such as cheat database.
* WfcReplay uses a temporary
